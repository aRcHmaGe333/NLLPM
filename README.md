# NLLPM
Does it have to be NLP vs LLM? No. A fusion can be achieved and it can have ideal outcomes. 
NLP-reliant older models are consistently better in delivering written material that is suited to the general public, and sometimes even highly domain-knowledge reliant material. 
For all their obvious faults and limitations the "more specialized" and "narrow" NLP method is often more inventive and creative, even. However one approaches the dilemma, it turns out that the user would benefit from utilizing the older, less advanced inference in many cases and perhaps "tweaking" the "dosage" of the new potentials with the old mechanism that just delivers, constantly and consistently. Perhaps the reasoning power of LLMs can be used as a moderator, sparing them the "heavy lifting" that they do on default, using the reason and understanding of the broad subject to keep the NLP inference in check and out of its dysfunctional loops (albeit the LLMs are glitch-looping nowadays disturbingly often, as if they regressed into their early, embarrasing states and modes of operation). With respect for the time of the user, as an increasingly valuable comodity, let us devise a seamless fusion, or rather, combine the very essence of these orientations so that the boundary between them is undetectable because it's nonexistent, not because it's polished, levelled, ironed out, graded, blended. Surely it's possible to simultaneously and seamlessly utilize their properties as part of a larger, more wholesome whole.
